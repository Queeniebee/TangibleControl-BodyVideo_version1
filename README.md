## Tangible Control::Body Video
### Version 1

Intro to Computational Media Final and first version of the interactive distortion system.

Tangible Control::Body Video is a video distortion system where the Viewer-User-Player must 'fight' for control. This is version 1 of the system, my Intro to Computational Media Final. The VUP input is manifested within the mouse input. VUPs look into a large projection of the video and move the mouse to alter the level of distortion.
